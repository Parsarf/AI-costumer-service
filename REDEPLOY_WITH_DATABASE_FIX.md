# ðŸš€ Redeploy with Database Fix

## The Problem
Railway removed your deployment because it kept crashing due to missing database tables.

## âœ… **SOLUTION: Redeploy with Database Setup**

### **Step 1: Create Database Setup Script**
We need to ensure the database tables are created during deployment.

### **Step 2: Update Railway Environment**
Make sure all environment variables are set correctly.

### **Step 3: Redeploy**
Trigger a new deployment that will create the database tables.
