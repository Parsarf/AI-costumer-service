## ðŸŽ¯ **Alternative: Use Railway CLI with Service Link**

If you prefer using CLI:

```powershell
# First, link to the service
railway link

# Then run migration
railway run npx prisma migrate deploy
```

---

## âœ… **After Migration**

Your app will be **FULLY WORKING**! ðŸŽ‰

Test it:
```
https://ai-customerservice-production.up.railway.app/health
```

---

## ðŸ†˜ **Why This Happens**

- Railway created the database but didn't run the table creation scripts
- The migration needs to run **on Railway's servers**, not locally
- Railway dashboard terminal has direct database access

---

**Go to Railway dashboard now and run the migration!** ðŸš€
