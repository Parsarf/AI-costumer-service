# ⏳ Wait for Railway to Finish

## ✅ **Good News!**

Your environment variables are being set! Railway is just rate-limiting because it tries to redeploy after each variable.

---

## ⏱️ **What to Do:**

### **Step 1: Wait 5 Minutes**
Railway needs time to:
- Finish setting all variables
- Complete the redeployment
- Start your app

### **Step 2: Add Remaining Variables**

After 5 minutes, run these in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\owner\Desktop\AI assistant\AI-costumer-service\backend"

# Add the remaining variables
railway variables --set FREE_PLAN=false
railway variables --set LOG_LEVEL=info

# Generate and add JWT_SECRET
$JWT_SECRET = node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
railway variables --set JWT_SECRET=$JWT_SECRET

# Generate and add ENCRYPTION_KEY
$ENCRYPTION_KEY = node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
railway variables --set ENCRYPTION_KEY=$ENCRYPTION_KEY
```

### **Step 3: Check Status**

After another 3 minutes:
```powershell
railway status
```

### **Step 4: View Logs**
```powershell
railway logs
```

You should see:
```
🚀 Shopify AI Support Bot running on port 3001
Environment: production
App URL: https://ai-customerservice-production.up.railway.app
```

---

## 🗄️ **Run Database Migrations:**

Once the app is running without errors:

```powershell
railway run npx prisma migrate deploy
```

---

## ✅ **Test Your App:**

### **Health Check:**
Open in browser:
```
https://ai-customerservice-production.up.railway.app/health
```

Should show:
```json
{"status": "healthy"}
```

---

## 📋 **Current Status:**

✅ App deployed to Railway  
✅ Domain generated: `ai-customerservice-production.up.railway.app`  
⏳ Environment variables being set (wait 5 min)  
⏳ App will auto-redeploy  
⏳ Then run migrations  
⏳ Then update Shopify URLs  

---

## 🎯 **Timeline:**

- **Now**: Wait 5 minutes
- **+5 min**: Add remaining variables (JWT_SECRET, ENCRYPTION_KEY)
- **+8 min**: Check logs - app should be running
- **+10 min**: Run migrations
- **+12 min**: Test health endpoint
- **+15 min**: Update Shopify URLs and test installation

**Total: 15 minutes to fully working app!** ⏱️

---

## 🆘 **If It's Still Crashing After 10 Minutes:**

Run:
```powershell
railway logs
```

And share the error message with me!

---

## ☕ **Take a 5-Minute Break!**

Let Railway finish deploying. When you come back:
1. Run the remaining variable commands
2. Check logs
3. Run migrations
4. You're done!

**Your app is 95% deployed!** 🚀
