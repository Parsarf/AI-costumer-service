# ðŸš€ Railway Migration Fix

## The Problem
The database tables don't exist yet, causing the app to crash with:
```
MissingSessionTableError: Prisma session table does not exist
```

## âœ… **SOLUTION: Run Migration via Railway Dashboard**

### **Step 1: Go to Railway Dashboard**
1. Open: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Click on your project: **AI-CustomerService**
3. Click on your service: **AI-CustomerService**

### **Step 2: Open Terminal in Railway**
1. Click on the **"Deployments"** tab
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Click **"View Logs"**
4. Click **"Open Shell"** (or "Terminal" button)

### **Step 3: Run Migration Commands**
In the Railway terminal, run these commands one by one:

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

### **Step 4: Restart the Service**
After running the migrations:
1. Go back to the **"Deployments"** tab
2. Click **"Redeploy"** or **"Restart"**

## ðŸ”„ **Alternative: Use Railway CLI with Service Link**

If the above doesn't work, try this:

```powershell
# Link to the specific service
railway link

# Run migration on the linked service
railway run npx prisma migrate deploy
```

---

## âœ… **After Migration**

Your app will be **FULLY WORKING**! ðŸŽ‰

Test it:
```
https://ai-customerservice-production.up.railway.app/health
```

Should return:
```json
{"status": "healthy"}
```

## ðŸ†˜ **If Still Having Issues**

The Railway dashboard terminal is the most reliable way to run migrations. The local CLI sometimes has connection issues with Railway's internal database.
